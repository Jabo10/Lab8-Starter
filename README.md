Graceful Degradation: I believe that graceful degradation (GD) and service workers (SW) are related because they both aim to help the user when it comes to their environment in which they access. They may be accessing under the not so optimal conditions,so what GD and SW aim to do is ensure the application that is being used by the user is able to maintain its proper functionality even when the highest features are not supported. For instance service workers enable functioning offline features that help with poor connections essentially maintining usability and performance much like GD regardless of outside factors.
